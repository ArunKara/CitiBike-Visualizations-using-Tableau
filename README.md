Tableau Homework

Based on Citi Bike Data from 06/2013 I have created two dashboards. One labeled “Dashboard on User Information” and the other labeled “Dashboard on Money.” Looking at the “Dashboard on User Information,” it has three visualizations that I felt would help sum up the overall demographics of our users. The map on the far left shows the locations of the Users based on Start Station Latitude and Longitude, and splits our Users by User Type into Customers and Subscribers and has displays them on individual maps. Next I applied a marker based on gender represented by color, the color corresponding to the gender can be seen in the legend, and if you click each color you’ll be able to highlight which gender you want to focus on. As well as the size of the circle on each map represents the count of the user type. This allows us to pin point the areas where our users use our bikes the most based on the frequency (count). As well as what type of user and gender they are. Some key features of the map shows, base topography; land cover; terrain; coastline; streets, highways, and routes; zip code boundaries; cities; points of interest; and neighborhoods; and as you zoom in to specific points it will reveal more and more information

In the center I created a bar chart which breaks down our users by user type and gender. Both visualizations can be highlighted using the same gender legend. The top half of the bar chart shows the breakdown of the count of the start station id, which shows how often each user type as well as gender uses our bikes. And the bottom half shows the average trip duration which shows how far the average user type and gender uses our bikes.

The visualization to the right shows the average trip duration based off of Birth Year, and then put a filter based on the top 50%, this tells us what age are using our product the longest. Which is a key piece when creating our marketing plan. As well as each color represents the same gender as all the other maps do as well.

With this dashboard you are able to answer the following questions:

•	How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period? Which is 65,500, of which 32,030 are customers, and 33,470 are subscribers.
•	What is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)? Which is 26,302 male participants and 7,168 female participants.
•	How does the average trip duration change by age? Top 5 average trip duration by age is 1942 with 6,611 ; 1995 with 5,033 ; 1949 with 4,660 ; 1945 with 4,372 ; 1951 with 3493 ; and 1964 with 3293.


•	Based on User Type and Gender, the average distance is 2,826 for customers which doesn’t require a gender, and 971 for subscribers that doesn’t require a gender, 2,082 for subscribers that are male, 2,132 for subscribers that are female. 

Now focusing on the second visualization titled “Dashboard on Money.” The visualization to the left is a map of New York with the a lot of the city geographics and labels mapped out, based on the start station latitude and end station latitude. After I put a two markers, one based on the color of the circles to equal the count of start station ID, which represents the frequency that people are starting our bike service. Light blue being the least frequent, and dark blue being the most frequent. As well as the size of the circle represents the total trip duration each area is getting based on the sum of the trip duration. This allows us to target high traffic areas where we could start to add more bikes as demand increases. Some key features of the map shows, base topography; land cover; terrain; coastline; streets, highways, and routes; zip code boundaries; cities; points of interest; and neighborhoods; and as you zoom in to specific points it will reveal more and more information.

In the center are two bar graphs. The top shows the most frequent start stations based on the count of the start station ID, as well as shows the location based on start station name. I added a filter based on start station count, to only show the top 11 locations. By highlighting over each individual bar you are able to the frequency as well as the full name. The lower of the two bar graphs, shows the most frequent end stations based on the count of the end station ID, as well as shows the location based on the end station name. And applied a filter based on start station count, to only show the top 11 locations.

On the right side is a bar graph showing which bikes have had the most use filtered by the sum of trip duration greater than 500,000, as well as where they are located based on end station name. This is something we can send out to the maintenance crew to check on the bikes to make sure we never get a bad service review. As that could hurt the business, especially if a subscriber is the one that happens to pick up a faulty bike.

With this dashboard you are able to answer the following questions:
•	What are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?) Which are E 17 st. & Broadway  ; W 20 st. & 11 Ave ; Broadway & E 14 st. ; Broadway & W 58 st. ; Broadway & W 24 st. ; 8 Ave & W 31 st. N ; West Thames St ; Lafayette St & E 8 St ; Christopher st. & Greenwich st. ; West st. & Chamber st. ; Carmine st. & 6 Ave


•	What are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?) Which are E 17 st. & Broadway  ; Broadway & E 58 st. ; W 20 st & 11 Ave ; Broadway & E 14 st. ; West Thames St ; Broadway & W 24 st ; 8 Ave & W 31 st. N ; West st. & Chamber st. ; Central Park S & 6 Ave ; Christopher st. & Greenwich st. ; ; Lafayette St & E 8 St
•	Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan? Based on the Bike ID with highest sum of trip duration, we can see that the top 5 Bike IDs and their locations are 15259 at Broadway & W 53 st ; 17918 at W 56 st and 10 ave ; 17215 at Perishing Square North ; 18359 at Franklin Ave and Myrtle Ave ; 15441 at Watts Street and Greenwich St.

I hope you find these two dashboards helpful in understand how CitiBikes helps New York! Feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns. As well as if you would like to see anymore visualizations. I’ve answered some of your questions based on the dashboard for easy reference.
